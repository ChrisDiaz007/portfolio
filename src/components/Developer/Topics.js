      "I had some interest in software development for some time, but my journey truly began when i decided to enroll for LeWagon Web Development Bootcamp in Tokyo, I tried to self study here and there, but with so much recources in the internet now a days i felt too overwhelmed with all the information and didn't have a devisive plan on where to start. One day as i was scrolling around the web, I saw an ad about le wagon, did some research, decided to enroll in Tokyo, Japan, and let me tell you it was one of the best experiences i had, I previously visited Japan twice so i didn't mind living so far away from home. Skip 3 months and now i give my thanks to Le Wagon,  all T.A. for all the help and guidance throught my first steps, and now I can say I am now a proud graduate for Batch #1885.",

      "Ruby is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity, productivity, and elegant syntax. Designed to be intuitive and easy to read, Ruby emphasizes developer happiness and quick development cycles. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming. Ruby is particularly famous for its web framework, Ruby on Rails, which facilitates rapid application development by providing conventions and tools for building web applications efficiently. The language's flexibility, combined with its rich ecosystem of libraries and a strong community, makes it popular for web development, scripting, and prototyping.",
