      "How it all began: I had some interest in software development for some time, but my journey truly began when i enrolled for LeWagon Web Development Bootcamp in Tokyo, I tried to self study here and there, but with so much recources in the internet now a days i felt too overwhelmed with all the information and didn't have a devisive plan on where to start. One day i was scrolling around in the web and saw an ad about le wagon, did some research, decided to enroll in Tokyo, Japan, and let me tell you it was one of the best experiences i had, I also visited Japan twice so i didn't mind enrolling so far away from home. Thank you Le Wagon, and Professors for all the guidance, i am now a proud graduate for Batch #1885.",

Designed to be intuitive and easy to read, Ruby emphasizes developer happiness and quick development cycles. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming. Ruby is particularly famous for its web framework, Ruby on Rails, which facilitates rapid application development by providing conventions and tools for building web applications efficiently. The language's flexibility, combined with its rich ecosystem of libraries and a strong community, makes it popular for web development, scripting, and prototyping.",
